# AI-Powered Code Reviewer - Project Template

## 1. Project Overview
### Objective:
Develop an AI-powered code reviewer web application that analyzes code quality, identifies errors, provides suggestions, and ensures adherence to best practices.

### Key Features:
- **Syntax & Error Checking**: Detects syntax errors and common mistakes.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Uses an AI model (GPT, Llama, or a custom-trained model) to suggest improvements.
- **Automated Review Comments**: Provides inline comments in the code.
- **Security & Vulnerability Analysis**: Identifies potential security issues.
- **Performance & Complexity Analysis**: Suggests optimizations.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: Ensures code originality.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports Python, Java, C++, and more.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Interactive and user-friendly UI for easy code submission and review.

## 2. Tech Stack
### Core Components:
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, or Vue.js.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Flask, or Node.js.
- **AI Model**: OpenAI API (GPT-4), Hugging Face models, or a custom-trained model.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB (for storing past reviews).
- **Code Analysis Tools**: Pylint, ESLint, SonarQube, Bandit (for security checks).
- **Hosting**: AWS, Firebase, or Vercel.

## 3. Architecture & Workflow
1. **User Submits Code** → Uploads via web interface.
2. **Code Preprocessing** → Tokenization, formatting checks.
3. **AI Analysis** → LLM suggests improvements, detects issues.
4. **Static Code Analysis** → Uses tools like Pylint, ESLint.
5. **Security & Performance Checks** → Identifies vulnerabilities.
6. **Plagiarism Detection** → Compares against known repositories.
7. **Generate Review Report** → Inline comments + summary report.
8. **Feedback & Iteration** → User gets suggestions to refine code.

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. **Develop Frontend**: Build a web UI with React/Next.js.
2. **Set up Backend API**: Implement FastAPI/Flask to handle requests.
3. **Integrate AI model**: Use OpenAI API or fine-tune a model.
4. **Implement Code Analysis**: Static analysis + AI-based insights.
5. **Connect Database**: Store and retrieve review history.
6. **Deploy Web App**: Host on AWS, Firebase, or Vercel.
7. **Testing & Optimization**: Ensure accuracy & efficiency.
