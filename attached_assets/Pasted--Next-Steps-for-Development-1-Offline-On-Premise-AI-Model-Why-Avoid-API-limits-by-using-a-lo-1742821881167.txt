 Next Steps for Development
1️⃣ Offline & On-Premise AI Model
🔹 Why? Avoid API limits by using a local or self-hosted model instead of relying solely on OpenAI's API.
🔹 How?

Use GPT-4 All, LLama, or CodeLLama for local AI processing.

Deploy Ollama (https://ollama.ai/) to run AI models locally.

Use Hugging Face models like Salesforce/codegen for Python/JavaScript analysis.

Build a Dockerized AI Service so it runs anywhere.

2️⃣ Hybrid AI Processing (Cloud + Local)
🔹 Why? Combine local AI + OpenAI API for cost-efficiency.
🔹 How?

Use local AI for basic linting & syntax checks.

Use OpenAI API only for deep analysis & explanations.

Implement an auto-switching mechanism:

If API quota is available → use OpenAI API.

If quota runs out → fall back to local AI.

3️⃣ Self-Improving AI Model (Fine-Tuning & Learning)
🔹 Why? Make the AI smarter over time by training it on real-world code reviews.
🔹 How?

Store user-submitted code + AI feedback in a database.

Periodically fine-tune a local AI model on past reviews.

Use vector embeddings (e.g., FAISS or ChromaDB) for smarter context-based recommendations.

4️⃣ GitHub/GitLab Integration
🔹 Why? Automate code reviews inside pull requests.
🔹 How?

Create a GitHub Action / GitLab CI pipeline that runs the AI on every PR.

Auto-comment suggestions directly in the pull request review.

Allow users to approve, reject, or edit AI suggestions before applying.

5️⃣ VS Code Plugin
🔹 Why? Developers can get live AI suggestions inside VS Code.
🔹 How?

Build an extension using TypeScript & the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Show inline AI comments & fix suggestions in the editor.

Add a "Fix with AI" button that auto-corrects bad code.

6️⃣ AI-Powered Auto-Fixes
🔹 Why? Instead of just giving feedback, let AI fix code automatically.
🔹 How?

Implement an "Apply AI Fix" button next to each suggestion.

AI rewrites & updates the code in-place.

Show before & after diffs so users can review changes.

7️⃣ Security & Performance Optimization
🔹 Why? Ensure the AI handles large files, malicious code, & scaling.
🔹 How?

Limit execution time for large files.

Sanitize inputs to prevent remote code execution (RCE).

Use WebSockets to stream AI responses in real-time.

Enable caching for repeated queries to save API usage.
